## How to run
Note: due to limitation of xlearn lib compiling, you need to run ubuntu in order for the library to build successfully (we personally tested ubuntu 16.04, 16.10 and it was fine.)

1. install python 3.7 or higher
2. go to project folder
3. use command `pip install -r requirement.txt`
4. run the codes.
